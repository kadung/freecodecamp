/*
	- Construct JavaScript Objects with Functions:
	We are also able to create objects using constructor functions. A constructor function is given a capitalized name to make it clear that it is a constructor.
	Here's an example of a constructor function:
		var Car = function() {
		  this.wheels = 4;
		  this.engines = 1;
		  this.seats = 5;
		};
	In a constructor, the "this" variable refers to the new object being created by the constructor. So when we write,
		this.wheels = 4;
