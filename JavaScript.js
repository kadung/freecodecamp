	JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.
	We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, as "var name_of_variable;"
	Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
