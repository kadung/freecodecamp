							<h3> Here is timeline of Dr Alan Turing's life:</h3>
							<ul style="font-size:20px">
							  <li>1912: Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1918: Alan joins St Michael's day school in Hastings, where he does not do very well. He is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School when he is ten where he does much better and learns to play chess.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1926: Alan becomes a pupil at Sherborne School in Dorset. Alan is not interested in their traditional classical education as he really wants to spend his time doing Science and Mathematics</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1931: Alan becomes an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge to study Mathematics. He enjoys university and is highly successful. He graduates with distinction</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1935: Alan's work is so distinguished that he is elected Fellow of King's College, aged only 23.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1938: Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1939: With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1943 : Alan is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking).</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1945: At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1946: Alan joins the National Physical Laboratory, in Teddington and he publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1950: Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will become very famous.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1952: January - Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1954: June 8th - Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>1966: The annual Turing Award is established and given each year to a person for technical contributions to the computing community. It is generally viewed as important as the Nobel Prize.</li>
							  <br>
							  <li>2009: In response to a petition signed by thousands of people, The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown issues a public apology in which he describes the treatment of Alan Turing as "appalling".</li>
